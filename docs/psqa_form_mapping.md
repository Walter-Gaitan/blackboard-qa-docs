9. **Time Spent** (Text) (Wait, prompt says "Add time spent... (Radio: Done)" but usually time is text. Prompt says: "Add time spent on QA as a comment in the SharePoint list: PSQA time: 1h 40m (Radio: Done)". Ah, it asks to *add* the comment in SharePoint, then click Done in the form?
   - Re-reading prompt: "Add time spent on QA as a comment in the SharePoint list: PSQA time: 1h 40m (Radio: Done)" -> It seems the *question* on the form is asking if you did this action. It's a Radio button "Done".
   - *Correction*: The prompt says "Total: 10 questions". Let's count.
